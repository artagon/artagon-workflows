Artagon open source project, you agree to the terms of this Agreement.

## 1. Definitions

- **"Contribution"** means any source code, object code, documentation,
  translation, artwork, data, or other material submitted to Artagon in
  any form, including submissions via pull request, email, issue
  tracker, or other collaboration tools.
- **"Project"** means the Artagon open source project to which a
  Contribution is submitted.
- **"You"** means the individual signing this Agreement. If you make
  Contributions within the scope of your employment, you confirm that
  your employer has authorized the Contribution or that you have a
  separate corporate CLA in place.

## 2. License Grant

2.1 **Copyright License.** You grant Artagon and recipients of software
     distributed by Artagon a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive,
     royalty-free, transferable license to reproduce, prepare derivative
     works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
     distribute your Contribution and such derivative works under (a)
     the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ("AGPL-3.0"), and
     (b) the Artagon Commercial License, as updated from time to time.

2.2 **Patent License.** You grant Artagon and its recipients a
     worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable
     patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
     import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such rights
     apply only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily
     infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your
     Contribution with the Project.

2.3 **Moral Rights.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, you waive
     and agree not to assert moral rights in your Contribution.

## 3. Representations

You represent and warrant that:

1. Each Contribution is your original work and you have the right to
   grant the rights described in this Agreement. If your Contribution
   includes third-party materials, you will identify them and include
   license information.
2. Your Contribution does not knowingly violate any third-party rights,
   including intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights.
3. You are legally entitled to enter into this Agreement and, if your
   employer has intellectual property ownership rights in your
   Contributions, you have received authorization to submit the
   Contribution on behalf of your employer (attach evidence if
   requested).
4. You understand that Artagon may publicly disclose your name and
   Contribution history in association with the Project.

## 4. Contribution Process

- Submit Contributions through Artagon's official repositories and
  communication channels.
- Include the standard header from `SOURCE-FILE-HEADER.txt` where
  applicable.
- Respond to review feedback and maintain compliance with Project
  contribution guidelines.
- Sign this Agreement once; it applies to all future Contributions to
  Projects owned by Artagon.

## 5. License Acceptance

Artagon may use, modify, and redistribute your Contribution under both
AGPL-3.0 and the Artagon Commercial License. This dual license model
ensures continued open source availability while supporting commercial
offerings. You acknowledge that you will not receive compensation for
your Contributions unless agreed separately in writing.

## 6. Disclaimer

You provide Contributions "AS IS" without warranties or conditions of
any kind. Artagon is not obligated to use or distribute your
Contribution.

## 7. Governing Law

without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be
resolved in the state or federal courts located in New Castle County,
Delaware.

## 8. Entire Agreement

This Agreement is the entire understanding between you and Artagon
regarding Contributions to the Project and supersedes prior agreements
relating to the subject matter. If any provision is unenforceable, the
remainder remains in effect.
