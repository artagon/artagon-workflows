## Quick Start

### Maven CI Example

```yaml

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ci:
    uses: artagon/artagon-workflows/.github/workflows/maven_ci.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
```

### C++ CI Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  ci:
    uses: artagon/artagon-workflows/.github/workflows/cmake_cpp_ci.yml@v1
    with:
      cmake-options: '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release'
    secrets: inherit
```

### Bazel CI Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:

    with:
      bazel-configs: 'release,debug'
    secrets: inherit
```

## Versioning

Workflows are versioned using git tags. Pin to a specific version for stability:

```yaml
# Pin to major version (recommended)
uses: artagon/artagon-workflows/.github/workflows/maven_ci.yml@v1

# Pin to specific release
uses: artagon/artagon-workflows/.github/workflows/maven_ci.yml@v1.2.0

# Use latest (not recommended for production)
uses: artagon/artagon-workflows/.github/workflows/maven_ci.yml@main
```

## Release Strategy

Artagon projects follow a **release branch strategy** for stable, predictable releases:

### Branch Structure

- **`main` branch**: Always has SNAPSHOT versions (e.g., `1.0.9-SNAPSHOT`)
- **`release-X.Y.Z` branches**: Have release versions without SNAPSHOT (e.g., `1.0.8`)
- **Tags**: Created on release branches (e.g., `v1.0.8`)

### Release Process

```bash
# 1. Ensure main is at next SNAPSHOT version
main: 1.0.9-SNAPSHOT

# 2. Create release branch from commit at desired SNAPSHOT
git checkout -b release-1.0.8 <commit-at-1.0.8-SNAPSHOT>
git push origin release-1.0.8

# 3. Trigger release workflow from release branch
# The workflow removes -SNAPSHOT and creates v1.0.8 tag

# 4. Result
main:          1.0.9-SNAPSHOT (unchanged)
release-1.0.8: 1.0.8          (frozen for hotfixes)
tag v1.0.8:    created
```

### Key Principles

- ‚úÖ Main branch **always** has SNAPSHOT versions
- ‚úÖ Release branches **never** have SNAPSHOT versions
- ‚úÖ Releases are **only** created from `release-*` branches
- ‚úÖ Release branches are **kept** for hotfixes (not deleted)
- ‚úÖ Tags are created on release branches
