# Example: Tag-Based Release Workflow
#
# This workflow publishes releases when a git tag is pushed.
# Copy this to your project's .github/workflows/release-tag.yml
#
# Usage:
#   git tag -a v1.0.8 -m "Release 1.0.8"
#   git push origin v1.0.8
#
# For complete Java/Maven release strategy, see:
# https://github.com/artagon/artagon-workflows/blob/main/docs/RELEASE_JAVA.md
